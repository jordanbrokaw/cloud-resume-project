# Cloud Resume Project

This is part of my hands-on AWS infrastructure journey.

 **Tech Used:**
- S3 + CloudFront for static site hosting
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Route 53 for DNS (coming soon)
- HTML (custom-built resume content)
- Terraform (coming soon)

 This site is live and hosted on AWS: [Visit Project](http://cloud-resume-jordan.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)
